# Advanced Microprocessors – Laboratory
### Course: Advanced Microprocessors
### Academic Year: 2022–2023

This repository contains my laboratory work for the course
**Advanced Microprocessors**, focusing on **low-level embedded programming**
and **microcontroller-based system design**.

All laboratory exercises were implemented and tested **exclusively through
simulation/emulation**, without deployment on physical hardware.

## 🧠 Tools & Platforms

Two different development environments and processor architectures were used:

### 🔹 Exercise 1
- **Architecture:** ARM-based processor
- **Toolchain:** Keil IDE
- **Programming Language:** C
- **Execution:** Simulation only

### 🔹 Exercises 2–5
- **Microcontroller:** ATmega4808 (AVR)
- **Toolchain:** Microchip Studio
- **Programming Language:** Embedded C
- **Execution:** Simulation only (no physical board)

## 🧪 Laboratory Exercises Overview

### 🔹 Exercise 1 – ARM Microprocessor Programming
A set of introductory and intermediate exercises implemented on an ARM-based
processor using Keil, focusing on low-level programming concepts and
processor behavior.

---

### 🔹 Exercise 2 – Traffic Light Controller
Simulation of a traffic light control system using an AVR microcontroller.
The exercise focuses on timing, state transitions, and peripheral control.

---

### 🔹 Exercise 3 – Smart Vacuum System
Design and simulation of a simple embedded control system representing a
“smart vacuum cleaner”, emphasizing logic control and system behavior.

---

### 🔹 Exercise 4 – RAM Management
Implementation and simulation of memory-related functionality, focusing on
RAM usage, data handling, and low-level memory operations.

---

### 🔹 Exercise 5 – Smart Home System
Simulation of a basic smart home scenario, integrating multiple logical
components and control flows within an embedded environment.
